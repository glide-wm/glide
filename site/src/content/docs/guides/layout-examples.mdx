description: Example tiling layouts and how to create them
---

This guide shows you how to create common tiling layouts in Glide using the default key bindings. Each example includes a visual diagram and step-by-step instructions.

:::note[Mac keyboard note]
Throughout this documentation, "Alt" refers to the Option (⌥) key on Mac keyboards. For example, "Alt+Z" means pressing Option+Z.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure:
- Glide is running (`glide launch`)
- You've activated the current space with **Alt+Z**
- You have at least 2-4 windows open to work with

## Basic Concepts

### Window Focus and Movement
- **Alt+H/J/K/L** - Move focus between windows (vim-style: H=left, J=down, K=up, L=right)
- **Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L** - Move the current window in a direction

### Splitting and Grouping
- **Alt+Backslash** - Create a horizontal split (windows side-by-side)
- **Alt+Equal** - Create a vertical split (windows stacked)
- **Alt+T** - Create a horizontal group (tabbed layout)
- **Alt+S** - Create a vertical group (stacked layout)
- **Alt+E** - Remove grouping

## Example 1: Two-Column Layout

The simplest tiling layout - two windows side by side.

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│             │             │
│   Window 1  │   Window 2  │
│             │             │
│             │             │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**How to create:**
1. Start with Window 1 in focus
2. Open Window 2 - Glide automatically tiles it next to Window 1

**Result:** Two windows split horizontally across the screen.

## Example 2: Three-Column Layout

Three windows arranged side by side.

```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│         │         │         │
│ Window 1│ Window 2│ Window 3│
│         │         │         │
│         │         │         │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

**How to create:**
1. Start with a two-column layout (Window 1 and Window 2)
2. Open Window 3 - it will be added to the layout
3. Use **Alt+H/J/K/L** to navigate and **Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L** to rearrange if needed

**Result:** Three equal columns across the screen.

## Example 3: Two Columns with Stacked Group

A main window on the left with multiple stacked windows on the right.

```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
│              │ [W2][W3][W4] │
│              │──────────────│
│   Window 1   │              │
│              │   Window 2   │
│              │   (active)   │
│              │              │
│              │              │
└──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**How to create:**
1. Start with Window 1 in focus
2. Open Window 2 - it appears next to Window 1
3. Press **Alt+Equal** to create a vertical split on the right
4. Press **Alt+S** to convert to a stacked group
5. Open Window 3 - it appears in the stack below Window 2
6. Open Window 4 - it appears in the stack below Window 3

**Key actions:**
- Create vertical split: **Alt+Equal**
- Convert to stacked group: **Alt+S**
- Navigate within stack: **Alt+J/K** (down/up)

**Result:** One large window on the left, multiple stacked windows on the right with one visible at a time. You can switch between the stacked windows with Alt+J/K.

## Example 4: Both Columns with Vertical Containers

Two columns, each containing vertical containers.

```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
│              ║              │
│   Window 1   ║   Window 3   │
│              ║              │
│──────────────║──────────────│
│              ║              │
│   Window 2   ║   Window 4   │
│              ║              │
└──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**How to create:**
1. Start with Window 1 in focus
2. Press **Alt+Equal** to create a vertical split
4. Open Window 2 - it appears below Window 1
6. Open Window 3 - it appears below Windows 1 and 2
5. Press **Alt+Shift+L** to move Window 3 to the right
7. Press **Alt+Equal** to create a vertical split
9. Open Window 4 - it appears on the right

**Key actions:**
- Create vertical split: **Alt+Equal**
- Navigate within columns: **Alt+J/K**
- Move between columns: **Alt+H/L**

**Result:** Two columns of windows.

## Advanced Tips

### Resizing Windows
After creating any layout, you can resize windows with **Alt+Ctrl+H/J/K/L**. These bindings make the current window bigger by moving each edge outward:
- **Alt+Ctrl+H** - Expand left (move left edge left)
- **Alt+Ctrl+L** - Expand right (move right edge right)
- **Alt+Ctrl+J** - Expand down (move bottom edge down)
- **Alt+Ctrl+K** - Expand up (move top edge up)

### Reorganizing Windows
- Move windows between columns/stacks: **Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L**
- Ungroup: Focus a window in the group and press **Alt+E** to convert the parent group to a horizontal or vertical container

### Converting Between Stack and Tabs
- From stack to tabs: Focus the group and press **Alt+T**
- From tabs to stack: Focus the group and press **Alt+S**

### Tree Navigation (Advanced)
For complex layouts, you can use:
- **Alt+A** - Ascend to parent container
- **Alt+D** - Descend to child container

These commands change which node is selected in the layout tree, affecting how subsequent operations work. See the [keyboard-centric setup guide](/guides/keyboard-centric-setup#understanding-tree-navigation-ascenddescend) for more details.

## Troubleshooting

**Windows not tiling as expected?**

- Make sure you've activated the space with **Alt+Z**

## Next Steps

- Customize key bindings in `~/.config/glide/glide.toml`
- Learn about [keyboard-centric setup](/guides/keyboard-centric-setup) for full keyboard workflow
- See the [configuration reference](/reference/config) for all available options
