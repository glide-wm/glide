description: Example tiling layouts and how to create them
---

This guide shows you how to create common tiling layouts in Glide using the default key bindings. Each example includes a visual diagram and step-by-step instructions.

:::note[Mac keyboard note]
Throughout this documentation, "Alt" refers to the Option (⌥) key on Mac keyboards. For example, "Alt+Z" means pressing Option+Z.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure:
- Glide is running (`glide launch`)
- You've activated the current space with **Alt+Z**
- You have at least 2-4 windows open to work with

## Basic Concepts

### Window Focus and Movement
- **Alt+H/J/K/L** - Move focus between windows (vim-style: H=left, J=down, K=up, L=right)
- **Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L** - Move the current window in a direction

### Splitting and Grouping
- **Alt+Backslash** - Create a horizontal split (windows side-by-side)
- **Alt+Equal** - Create a vertical split (windows stacked)
- **Alt+T** - Create a horizontal group (tabbed layout)
- **Alt+S** - Create a vertical group (stacked layout)
- **Alt+E** - Remove grouping

### Resizing
- **Alt+Ctrl+H/J/K/L** - Resize the current window by 5% in a direction

## Example 1: Two-Column Layout

The simplest tiling layout - two windows side by side.

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│             │             │
│   Window 1  │   Window 2  │
│             │             │
│             │             │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**How to create:**
1. Start with Window 1 in focus
2. Open Window 2 - Glide automatically tiles it next to Window 1

**Result:** Two windows split horizontally across the screen.

## Example 2: Three-Column Layout

Three windows arranged side by side.

```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│         │         │         │
│ Window 1│ Window 2│ Window 3│
│         │         │         │
│         │         │         │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

**How to create:**
1. Start with a two-column layout (Window 1 and Window 2)
2. Open Window 3 - it will be added to the layout
3. Use **Alt+H/J/K/L** to navigate and **Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L** to rearrange if needed

**Result:** Three equal columns across the screen.

## Example 3: Two Columns with Stacked Group

A main window on the left with multiple stacked windows on the right (like a traditional IDE layout).

```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
│              │╔════════════╗│
│              │║  Window 2  ║│
│              │╚════════════╝│
│   Window 1   │┌────────────┐│
│              ││  Window 3  ││
│              │└────────────┘│
│              │┌────────────┐│
│              ││  Window 4  ││
└──────────────┴└────────────┘┘
```

**How to create:**
1. Start with Window 1 in focus
2. Open Window 2 - it appears next to Window 1
3. Press **Alt+L** to focus Window 2
4. Press **Alt+S** to create a vertical group (stacked layout)
5. Open Window 3 - it appears in the stack below Window 2
6. Open Window 4 - it appears in the stack below Window 3

**Key actions:**
- Focus the right column: **Alt+L**
- Create stacked group: **Alt+S**
- Navigate within stack: **Alt+J/K** (down/up)

**Result:** One large window on the left, multiple stacked windows on the right. You can switch between the stacked windows with Alt+J/K.

## Example 4: Two Columns with Tabbed Groups

Similar to Example 3, but using tabs instead of stacks.

```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
│              │ [W2][W3][W4] │
│              │──────────────│
│   Window 1   │              │
│              │   Window 2   │
│              │   (active)   │
│              │              │
│              │              │
└──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**How to create:**
1. Start with Window 1 in focus
2. Open Window 2 - it appears next to Window 1
3. Press **Alt+L** to focus Window 2
4. Press **Alt+T** to create a horizontal group (tabbed layout)
5. Open Window 3 - it appears as a tab
6. Open Window 4 - it appears as a tab

**Key actions:**
- Focus the right column: **Alt+L**
- Create tabbed group: **Alt+T**
- Navigate between tabs: **Alt+H/L** (left/right)

**Result:** One large window on the left, multiple tabbed windows on the right. You can switch between tabs with Alt+H/L.

## Example 5: Both Columns with Stacked Groups

Two columns, each containing stacked windows (advanced workspace setup).

```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
│╔════════════╗│╔════════════╗│
│║  Window 1  ║│║  Window 3  ║│
│╚════════════╝│╚════════════╝│
│┌────────────┐│┌────────────┐│
││  Window 2  │││  Window 4  ││
│└────────────┘│└────────────┘│
│              │              │
│              │              │
└──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**How to create:**
1. Start with Window 1 in focus
2. Press **Alt+S** to create a vertical group for the left column
3. Open Window 2 - it appears in the left stack
4. Press **Alt+L** to move focus to the right
5. Open Window 3 - it appears on the right
6. Press **Alt+S** to create a vertical group for the right column
7. Open Window 4 - it appears in the right stack

**Key actions:**
- Create left stack: **Alt+S** (with Window 1 focused)
- Move to right column: **Alt+L**
- Create right stack: **Alt+S** (with Window 3 focused)
- Navigate within stacks: **Alt+J/K**
- Move between columns: **Alt+H/L**

**Result:** Two columns of stacked windows. Great for organizing multiple tasks side by side.

## Advanced Tips

### Resizing Windows
After creating any layout, you can resize windows with **Alt+Ctrl+H/J/K/L**:
- **Alt+Ctrl+H** - Make narrower (move left edge right)
- **Alt+Ctrl+L** - Make wider (move right edge right)
- **Alt+Ctrl+J** - Make taller (move bottom edge down)
- **Alt+Ctrl+K** - Make shorter (move top edge down)

### Reorganizing Windows
- Move windows between columns/stacks: **Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L**
- Remove a window from a group: Focus the window and press **Alt+E**

### Converting Between Stack and Tabs
- From stack to tabs: Focus the group and press **Alt+T**
- From tabs to stack: Focus the group and press **Alt+S**

### Tree Navigation (Advanced)
For complex layouts, you can use:
- **Alt+A** - Ascend to parent container
- **Alt+D** - Descend to child container

These commands change which node is selected in the layout tree, affecting how subsequent operations work. See the [keyboard-centric setup guide](/guides/keyboard-centric-setup#understanding-tree-navigation-ascenddescend) for more details.

## Common Workflows

### IDE-like Layout
Use Example 3 (main window + stacked sidebar):
- Large code editor on the left
- Terminal, file browser, and documentation stacked on the right

### Multi-monitor Simulation
Use Example 5 (both columns stacked):
- Left column: Development windows (editor, terminal)
- Right column: Reference windows (browser, documentation)

### Communication Setup
Use Example 4 (main window + tabbed sidebar):
- Large content window on the left
- Tabbed communication apps on the right (Slack, email, calendar)

## Troubleshooting

**Windows not tiling as expected?**
- Make sure you've activated the space with **Alt+Z**
- Check that `default_disable = true` in your config (or manually activate each space)

**Can't see which window is focused?**
- Enable focus indicators in your config
- Use mouse-follows-focus: the cursor will move to the focused window

**Layout gets messed up?**
- Use **Alt+E** to ungroup containers
- Move windows back to desired positions with **Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L**
- In worst case, restart Glide with **Alt+Shift+E** and relaunch

## Next Steps

- Customize key bindings in `~/.config/glide/glide.toml`
- Learn about [keyboard-centric setup](/guides/keyboard-centric-setup) for full keyboard workflow
- See the [configuration reference](/reference/config) for all available options
