description: How to set up macOS for full keyboard use

## Intro

Most tiling window managers provide a first-class experience when working keyboard-only. Common examples are [Hyprland for Linux](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) and [AeroSpace for macOS](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace). Glide can provide the same workflow with a few tweaks to your system configuration.

## Hotkeys to switch macOS Spaces

macOS provides an option to configure hotkeys to switch to specific Spaces. They are hidden, though. To configure them:

1. Create several Spaces. As a rule of thumb, estimate your usual workflow, decide how many Spaces you need, and create them. They can be empty or contain any apps.
2. Go to `System Settings` -> `Keyboard` -> `Keyboard Shortcuts` -> `Mission Control`. In the `Mission Control` section, find `Switch to Desktop X`. Enable all checkboxes and, optionally, set your own hotkeys.

Now you can switch Spaces with the combination `^ + X` (`Control + X`), where `X` is the target Space number.

:::note
If you want add more Spaces with hotkeys, just follow the same steps - first create as many Spaces as you need, then go back to `Keyboard Shortcuts` and enable checkboxes

## Preserve Space order

macOS rearranges your Spaces by default so the most recently used appears closer to the first (main) Space. This is counterintuitive if you arranged your Spaces in a specific order, like Space 1 for browser and mail, Space 2 for the terminal, Space 3 for the IDE, etc.

Luckily this can be disabled by unchecking `System Settings` -> `Desktop & Dock` -> `Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use`.

When unchecked, macOS preserves the order of your Spaces. For example, you can place your browser in Space 1 and the terminal in Space 2, and that order will stay the same regardless of workflow.

## Glide neat options

By default Glide has to be activated on each Space individually. This can be changed:

```toml
[settings]

default_disable = false
```

You can enable space index to visualize your current Space. Note that this setting is experimental and might get changed or removed in the future.

```toml
[settings.experimental]

status_icon.space_index = true
```
