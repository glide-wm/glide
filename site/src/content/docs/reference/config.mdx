## Configuration file location

Glide looks for configuration in the following locations (in order of preference):

1. `~/.config/glide/glide.toml` (preferred, added in v0.2.9)
2. `~/.glide.toml` (legacy location, still supported)

You can also specify a custom config path using the `--config` flag when launching Glide.

Throughout this documentation, "Alt" refers to the Option (⌥) key on Mac keyboards.

## Working with default key bindings

As of v0.2.9, you can choose to extend the default key bindings instead of replacing them entirely.

### Extending defaults (new in v0.2.9)

Set `default_keys = true` in the `[settings]` section to include all default key bindings. You can then add your own or override specific ones:

```toml
[settings]
default_keys = true

[keys]
# Add a new key binding
"Alt + M" = { move_focus = "left" }

# Override a default binding
"Alt + Minus" = { split = "vertical" }

# Disable a default binding
"Alt + Equal" = "disable"
```

### Replacing defaults (traditional behavior)

If you want complete control, either:
- Don't set `default_keys` (defaults to `false`), or
- Set `default_keys = false`

Then define all your key bindings in the `[keys]` section.

:::tip
If you add an empty `[keys]` section without `default_keys = true`, all default key bindings will be disabled.

## Default configuration

The following is the default configuration file that ships with Glide:

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import defaults from '../../../../../glide.default.toml?raw';

<Code code={defaults} lang="toml" />
