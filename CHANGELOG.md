This is the first official release of Glide, a tiling window manager for macOS.

Glide is inspired by Sway and i3 on Linux. Features include:

* Spaces support
* Keyboard-based navigation
* Tiled and untiled windows
* Tabbed and stacked groups with navigation bars
* Enable/disable on individual spaces
* Text based config
* Animations

For a better idea of what Glide can do, have a look at the [default config].
